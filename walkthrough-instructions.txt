3A Server Walkthrough Instructions

Part I - Set up project locally
1) Fork the https://github.com/tonethar/3A-Server-Start.git repository (Alternatively, click the "Use this template" button)
2) Rename the repository to "3A-Server"
3) Move to your PC desktop, and `git clone <url>` your forked repository
4) Change directory into 3A-Server
5) Create a package.json file with the default values: `npm init -y` - then manually edit package.json and add a value for the "description" key
6) Download the shortid package: `npm install shortid`
7) Launch the server with: `node ./src/server.js`
8) Test the server in Chrome by heading to localhost:3000 & localhost:3000/random
9) In package.json, add an "engines" key to package.json, give correct values for both "node" and "npm"
10) In package.json, under the "scripts" key, change the "test" key value to "echo \"Tests Complete!\""
11) In package.json, under the "scripts" key, add a "start" key with a value of "node ./src/server.js"
12) In package.json, under the "scripts" key, add a "pretest" key, with a value of "eslint ./src --fix"
13) Look over the installation instructions for eslint at: https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint
14) Download the eslint packages as a developer dependency: `npm install eslint --save-dev`
15) Create an eslint config file with: `eslint --init`
  - **you will have to answer questions - please follow along with Professor!**
  - #1 - for "How would you like to use ESLint?" choose "To check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style"
  - #2 for "What type of modules does your project use?" choose "CommonJS (require/exports)"
  - #3 for Which framework does your project use? choose "None of these"
  - #4 for "Where does your code run?" choose "Node"
  - #5 for "How would you like to define a style for your project?" choose "Use a popular style guide"
  - #6 for "Which style guide do you want to follow?" choose "Airbnb"
  - #7 for "What format do you want your config file to be in?" choose "JSON"
  - The go ahead and choose "Y" when it asks to install these dependencies
16) Take a look at package.json to see the new "devDependencies" keys that were added
17) `npm test` will run the "pretest" and the "test" key from package.json - be sure to fix any errors, or edit the .eslintrc.json config file to turn them into warnings (if that's the right thing to do)
18) `npm start` will run the server. Then head to Chrome to be sure that both routes still work


Part II - Push to your GitHub
- create .gitignore and add node_modules to it
- `git status`
- `git add .`
- `git status`
- `git commit -m "First commit"`
- `git status`
- `git push`
- `git status`
- check 3A-Server repository on GitHub to make sure it's up to date

Part III - CircleCI
1) Head to https://circleci.com and set up an account if you need to
2) Click "Add Projects" button (you may have to link to GitHub first)
3) Choose 3A-Server and Click "Set up Project" button
4) Download config.yml file and save at .circleci/config.yml
5) Click "Start Building" button
 - ERROR! Fix this by adding/commiting/pushing .circleci/config.yml to GitHub and try again
 - After you push, check the "Pipelines" tab on CircleCI - your Project should be building automatically every time it is pushed
 - ERROR! Fix this by updating the node version in config.yml, and then adding/commiting/pushing the updates again
6) Check the Pipelines tab on CircleCI again. What is CircleCI doing? It's running `npm test` for you, and reporting on the results. This time it should pass the tests
7) Head to your 3A-Server repository on GitHub, click on the green checkmark next to "Latest commit", that gives a link to your latest CircleCI build (the one you passed)

Part IV - Heroku
1) Head to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps 
2) Create a new app, and give it a meaningful name like "abc1234-3a-server" (where abc1234 is your ID)
3) Choose "Deployment Method" GitHub
4) Connect to your 3A-Server repository
5) Click the "Automatic Deploys" button
6) Check the "Wait for CI to pass before deploy" checkbox
7) Click the "Deploy Branch" button to do a manual deploy (i.e. upload) to Heroku
8) Click on the "Activity" tab to see the progress of your build
9) Once it's finished, Click the "Open App" button to see your app in all it's glory. Test the / and the /random routes to be sure everything works.

Part V - Test it out.
1) Head back to your PC, and edit server.js so that the default HTML changes (maybe add some exclamation marks to the <h1>)
2) git add, git commit, git push
3) Head to https://circleci.com and check out the pipeline for the app - you should see it building
4) When it's done and succeeded, head to Heroku, and open the "Activity" tab for the project to see the build in progress
5) When that's done, reload the app's web page, you should see the changes

Part VI - What happens with code errors?
1) Edit server.js again, this time put a syntax error into your code (or an unused variable, or something else that will fail `npm test`
2) git add, git commit, git push
3) Head to https://circleci.com and check out the pipeline for the app - you should see it building - and then failing! Click the disclosure triangle to see why the build failed (or run `npm test` on the command line)
4) There is no step 4, because the app won't deploy to Heroku
5) On GitHub, the green checkmark is now a red x! :-(
